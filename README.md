# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
    The overview of this project is to determine the viability of a crowdfunding campaign to fund Louise's play "Fever". The metrics that were measured to determine the viabilit of a successful crowdfunding campaign was the percentage of sucessful projects types, monitary donation brackets, and time of year for succesfful project. Using these metrics we can determine an optomization to structure a campaign at a spesisific time of year with predeterminded suggested dontation amounts based on the data in this analaysis to best achieve a succesful campaign for Louise.

### Purpose
    The main purpose of this exercise is twofold: First, to expand and refine our skill with excel using formulas and other technical skills. Secondly, to gain a broader overview of understanding of the nature and theory behind statistics in the context of analyzing a broad spectrum of numbers in different contexts.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

    The graph shown displays the outcomes of various campaigns based on the month that they started. There was an increase in successful campaigns starting in April that peaked in May at over 100 successful campaigns, that steadily declined until September and then progressed down more until the end of the year in december. Failed campaigns and Canceled campaigns seemed to be unaffected in a significant way based on the time of year.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

    The graph shown displays the percent of succesful projects based on the goal amount set by the creator of the campaign. Based on our data sheet, the general trend shows that successful campaigns are the most likely to succede around the 1-5k dollar range, while until the 45k dollar bracket will remain around 50% to get funded. Anything more than this amount will drastically increase the chance that the campaign fails to get funded. The trend for the percentage of canceled projects seems to have a positve corelation to cancelation based on the amount of money set as a goal, with around 30 percent of the projects that get canceled with more than a 50k dollar goal
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
    The main challenges that I encounter was making sure my data set was staying consistant throughout spreadsheets, and to make sure my formulas were correct in order to maintain my data set to be as accurate as possible for analysis. I believe my outcomes based on goals graph looks slightly different from the one posted for the assignment, so i would be curious to see what I did that was different than the "correct" route if this is indeed true. Also getting my png graphs to show up in the readme, since its my first time doing something like this I am hoping the way I did it was workable.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    The conclusion that I can draw about the outcome of campaigns based on launch date is it seems that late spring going throughout summer is the best time for campaigns, since the total number of succesful campaigns peaked in may and declined steadilt until september. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    Based on my analysis of the outcomes based on goals, having a smaller amount under 10k dollars seems to have the best chance of getting funded, with the peak goal amount in the 1-5k dollar range at around 65%. Concersely, asking for more than 50k dollars as a goal will skyrocket the chance of failure based on the data set we analyized.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    Some potiental limitations of our dataset could be the data we are drawing information from is incomplete. There are many different websites for crowdfunding campaigns, including kickstater, Indiegogo, Patreon, GofundMe, etc. . Another limitation comes from the type of donations that are being recieved, since some sites like patreon offer monthly subscription type services that provide content creators an avenue to earn revenue every month by offering donators additional content or benefits, such as early access or premium content
    
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    If we can accumulate more data I would be curious to see how other donation platforms compare if this data set is indeed from only one site. Along with the location of a play, to compare rural/urban/suburban areas for where the plays are hosted, since population density might play a role in the success of campaigns for plays for people to see
